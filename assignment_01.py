# Title: How Image processing model saves life from skin cancer.

# 


#Introduction
# In recent years, Python-based image processing models have 
# become powerful tools in healthcare, especially for diagnosing
# skin cancer. These models use computer algorithms to analyze 
# medical images, helping doctors make more accurate and faster
# diagnoses. This research report explores how Phyton, and image
# processing are making a difference in healthcare, focusing on 
# their role in detecting skin cancer and improving patient care.

# Methodology
# We will review academic papers, research studies, and cases 
# that discuss Python-based image processing models in healthcare, 
# with a focus on skin cancer diagnosis. By analyzing these 
# sources, we hope to uncover important insights into how these 
# models are changing healthcare practices and outcomes.

# Preliminary Research
# Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is responsible for 75% of 
# skin cancer-related deaths (Vijayalakshmi M M. 2019). 
# However, advancements in image processing have significantly 
# impacted its diagnosis and treatment. Image processing models
# consist of three main stages: pre-processing, segmentation, 
# and feature extraction. These stages help reduce the time 
# taken to diagnose skin cancer and increase the accuracy of 
# the diagnosis.
# One of the key benefits of using image processing models 
# their impact on early detection. In case of stage one skin 
# cancer, the survival rate is almost 100%, reaching 99.9%. 
# this highlights the critical role of early detection in 
#improving patient outcomes.
# Additionally recent studies by G Bizel (2024) have 
# highlighted the positive impact of increased machine 
# learning methods on patient outcomes, not only in skin 
# cancer but also in other skin diseases. Machine learning 
# algorithms can classify images and gather patient- related 
# data, enabling the detection of skin diseases during analysis.
